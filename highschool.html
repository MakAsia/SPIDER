  <h1>Empty Halls</h1>
  <div class="story">
    The first morning back at high school felt like a ghost story come to life. Alessio stood at the entrance, staring up at the building's aging brick facade. Everything looked the same, yet nothing felt familiar. The air smelled like pencil shavings and floor wax, but also something heavier—loss.
    <br><br>
    He adjusted his black cap, letting the brim shadow his blue eyes, and pulled his dark hoodie tighter over his black cargo shirt. His boots echoed down the hall as he walked past rows of lockers, each one a memory, each one untouched by the chaos he’d survived.
    <br><br>
    But something was off.
    <br><br>
    Jack, a tall classmate with sharp eyes and too much curiosity, watched him from across the hall. Jack had always been suspicious, but now his gaze was invasive, almost predatory. Alessio could feel it—not on his skin, but in the vibration of the air. Ever since that spider bite, Alessio could feel everything.
    <br><br>
    The classrooms were loud with life, but Alessio sat in silence. His seat beside the window felt colder without Elias—his best friend, his brother in spirit. Elias’s laugh used to fill this room. Now it was just the ticking of the clock, and the faint, constant hum of something buried deep inside Alessio.
    <br><br>
    At lunch, he sat alone under the faded basketball banner in the gym. He watched the others joke and toss fries at each other. They laughed, but he couldn’t. Not with Elias gone.
    <br><br>
    The football field was where it all came crashing down.
    <br><br>
    Coach tossed him the ball, and his fingers gripped it harder than he meant. When he threw it, the spiral cracked like a cannon through the air, nearly knocking a player over. They clapped and cheered, but Alessio's hands trembled. His skin prickled. His muscles tensed with unnatural strength. He closed his eyes and focused. Breathe. Breathe.
    <br><br>
    Jack was on him again—asking questions. “You feeling okay, man? You’re… different.”
    <br><br>
    Alessio just nodded and walked away. He couldn’t explain what he was, not even to himself.
    <br><br>
    In the locker room, the lights flickered. Water dripped from an unseen pipe. The scent of metal and disinfectant mixed with something raw and wild.
    <br><br>
    Alessio stood in front of the mirror. The reflection stared back with fire in its eyes.
    <br><br>
    His fingers twitched. His veins lit beneath his skin for just a second—silver and glowing. He could feel the spider within him awaken, clawing its way up his spine. Power hummed in his bones.
    <br><br>
    “Not now,” he whispered to the storm inside him.
    <br><br>
    But it was already too late. Behind him, the locker metal warped and twisted slightly. Not enough for someone else to notice. But he did. He always noticed.
    <br><br>
    He missed Elias more than he knew how to say. But grief had turned to rage. And rage—fueled by power—was a dangerous thing.
    <br><br>
    That day, Alessio didn’t just walk the halls of high school.
    <br><br>
    He haunted them.
