  <h1>The Forest Awakening</h1>
  <div class="story">
    Alessio had always found peace in long drives at twilight. That evening, the sky over the distant forest burned orange and grey, the hour of shadows slowly creeping in. With his blonde hair tucked under a worn black cap, a fitted black shirt clinging to his lean but tall frame, cargo pants rugged from wear, and black combat boots laced tightly around his ankles, he pulled his car off a forgotten path and stepped into the woods like a soldier walking into mystery.
    <br><br>
    The forest was haunting. Trees stood tall like ancient guardians, their crooked limbs twisting into the sky, filtering the grey light into ghostly patterns on the damp earth. Mist drifted like breath from some sleeping beast, and the smell of moss, bark, and distant rain filled the air. The grey hour was neither day nor night—a strange in-between—and every step Alessio took felt as though he were walking through a dream that wasn't his.
    <br><br>
    Leaves crunched beneath his boots. A distant rustle. No birdsong. No wind. Just the rhythmic beat of his own footsteps—and a growing sense that something was watching. His breath became shallow. Eyes darting. He turned. Nothing. And then—
    <br><br>
    Pain. A sharp, electric sting on the side of his neck. He gasped and stumbled, slapping at the source. His hand came away with the crushed remains of a black spider streaked with red. Its fangs had sunk deep. For a moment, all he felt was the sting.
    <br><br>
    Then the fire began. Heat crawled through his veins. His vision blurred as if the forest had folded in on itself. His breath quickened. His heart thundered like war drums in his chest. A cold sweat broke over him. Numbness spread through his arms. He dropped to his knees, the forest spinning, and then fell face-forward into the leaves, his body overtaken by the venom.
    <br><br>
    Darkness.
    <br><br>
    When he awoke, night had fallen like a black veil. His cheek was pressed to wet moss, his clothes damp, his shirt clinging to him like second skin. Fog snaked along the ground, curling between tree roots like searching fingers. The forest no longer looked like a place of nature—but something alive, breathing, ancient.
    <br><br>
    His head throbbed. He sat up slowly, muscles aching like he'd been through battle. His breath came in short, cold bursts. The memory of the bite burned at his neck. Every part of him felt invaded—like something else now shared his body.
    <br><br>
    He stumbled toward the path, branches clawing at him, shadows whispering. When he saw the glint of his car, relief surged through him like light breaking through fog. He collapsed into the seat and started the engine. The road back was a blur, headlights cutting through the trees like a lifeline.
    <br><br>
    At home, his room felt like a foreign country. He tore off his shirt. His skin shimmered faintly under the light, lines glowing across his collarbone, down his arms. In the mirror, his blue eyes gleamed unnaturally, and when he clenched his fists, strength surged—not muscle, but something deeper, something ancient and crawling.
    <br><br>
    His hands itched. He flexed them. Silk shot from his wrist and latched to the wall with a sticky snap. He staggered back.
    <br><br>
    "No… no, no, no," he whispered, breath trembling.
    <br><br>
    But inside, something smiled.
    <br><br>
    That night, Alessio dreamed in webs. He saw himself swinging between rooftops, crawling up towers, leaping impossible distances. He could feel the world as if it were singing to him—vibrations in the air, heartbeats in walls, fear in strangers. The spider hadn’t just bitten him. It had rewritten him.
    <br><br>
    He was no longer alone in his body. Something more lived beneath his skin. And it wanted out.
    <br><br>
    As the moonlight poured into his room, glinting off the black boots beside his bed, Alessio realized the forest had not cursed him. It had chosen him.
