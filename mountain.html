  <h1>Storm on the Mountain</h1>
  <div class="story">
    The mountain loomed dark under a sky churning with grey fury. The wind howled like a living beast, dragging tree branches in its jaws, rattling the rocks, slamming against Alessio’s body like fists. The temperature had dropped suddenly—each gust slicing through his soaked clothes like shards of ice. Rain poured with relentless rage, flooding the narrow path as lightning lit up the cliffs in blinding bursts.
    <br><br>
    Alessio stood defiant, tall and steady. His black shirt clung to his chest, soaked through and chilled to the bone. Mud streaked the side of his cargo pants, and his black boots sloshed through wet earth. The brim of his cap kept the rain out of his burning red eyes. He looked like a shadow carved into the storm itself.
    <br><br>
    He wasn’t alone. Figures moved through the mist. But they weren’t alive. A man—normal by appearance—stood atop a stone ledge. His fingers twitched like a puppet master. From every corner of the fog, ghosts emerged. Transparent, hollow-eyed, whispering Alessio’s name. They drifted like smoke, crawling toward him with cracked hands and mournful cries. Each one was a memory, twisted and weaponized.
    <br><br>
    “Give up,” the man said. “Join the dead.”
    <br><br>
    Alessio gritted his teeth. He swiped at the air, tearing through a ghost, but three more came. His limbs felt heavy. His thoughts fogged. Somewhere nearby, something hit him hard in the ribs. He fell. Rolled. The invisible enemy.
    <br><br>
    A villain he couldn’t see, but could feel—a heartbeat skipping near, a shift in the rain. The shadows bent around the presence. Every attack was a mystery, a strike from nowhere.
    <br><br>
    Alessio screamed into the wind.
    <br><br>
    “ENOUGH!”
    <br><br>
    But even his voice was swallowed by the storm. He fell to his knees, drenched and bruised. The rain mixed with blood and mud. The ghosts swirled around him like vultures.
    <br><br>
    His breathing became erratic. He clutched his head. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t breathe.
    <br><br>
    Then—light.
    <br><br>
    A flame erupted behind him. Someone yelled his name. Electricity cracked the air, blowing back the fog. The cavalry had arrived.
    <br><br>
    Heroes—some familiar, others unknown—descended from the sky, from the cliffs, from the trees. Together, they struck back. Flame met ghost. Lightning danced across the invisible. And Alessio…
    <br><br>
    Alessio roared.
    <br><br>
    His body burned from the inside. Silver veins glowed beneath his skin. His back arched, his arms stretched, his muscles expanded and cracked through soaked fabric. His suit crawled over his skin like a living shadow. His cap flew off. His eyes ignited into molten fire. A blade of darkened steel and webbed lightning grew from his wrist.
    <br><br>
    He stood again—taller. A spider emblem pulsing on his chest. He wasn’t just a boy anymore. He was the storm.
    <br><br>
    He dashed forward, a blur of speed and fury. He sliced through ghost after ghost, leapt into the air, spun mid-flight, and landed directly where the invisible villain had been. The blade struck true. A scream echoed across the mountain.
    <br><br>
    The ghost master ran—but was crushed beneath a boulder thrown by one of the heroes.
    <br><br>
    The sky opened, and the rain slowed to a drizzle.
    <br><br>
    The mountain was quiet now. The ghosts had faded. The wind had stilled. The invisible villain was no more.
    <br><br>
    Alessio stood among the others. Breathing heavily. Alive.
    <br><br>
    He looked around at his allies—wounded but smiling. He looked at the battlefield—ruined but free.
    <br><br>
    He had been ready to fall. But in the darkness, others had reached for him.
    <br><br>
    Together, they had conquered the storm.
