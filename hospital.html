  <h1>Hospital - SpiderHero's Trial</h1>

  <div class="story">
    Alessio—now embracing the name SPIDER—found himself drawn to the hospital’s glowing silhouette through the city’s thick smoke and ash. The night had changed everything. After that fateful bite in the forest, his body throbbed with unfamiliar power, but his mind hungered for answers.
    <br><br>
    Earlier that evening, a colossal battle had shattered the city’s peace. The Fire Hero, blazing with fierce flames that tore through steel and stone, clashed against a villain whose name chilled even whispered legends—Jiro. The villain’s darkness swallowed light itself. Alessio had stalked the hero from afar, watching the blaze and destruction, desperate to understand if his newfound strength was a spark in the greater storm.
    <br><br>
    The hospital was a fortress of fragile hope, now a battlefield of desperation. The Fire Hero lay weakened in a glowing chamber, sweat mixing with ash on his burnt skin, eyes flickering with exhaustion and pain. Around him, injured civilians huddled in shadowed corridors, their cries muffled beneath the roaring fire alarms.
    <br><br>
    Suddenly, a chilling silence cut through the chaos. Jiro had arrived.
    <br><br>
    From the depths of the smoke, Jiro emerged, cloaked in darkness that seemed to writhe and pulse—his eyes like burning coals, his laugh a jagged scar on the night. The villain's presence sucked warmth from the air, his steps cracking the concrete beneath like thunder.
    <br><br>
    “You think you can save them, little spider?” Jiro hissed, voice dripping with venom.
    <br><br>
    Alessio’s heart slammed. But beneath the fear was something else: a burning resolve. His body surged with power—his fingers tingled, webs ready at his command. This was no longer the boy lost in the forest. This was SPIDER.
    <br><br>
    The fight ignited.
    <br><br>
    Jiro launched shadowy tendrils that twisted like serpents, slashing through the air toward Alessio. The young hero leapt, spinning through the smoke, releasing strands of silk that glittered silver under flickering emergency lights. Webs wrapped around Jiro’s arms, slowing the villain’s movements but not stopping the dark fury.
    <br><br>
    Flames erupted—both from Jiro’s shadows and the Fire Hero struggling to rise. The heat was unbearable, the fire roaring a savage anthem. Civilians screamed, but Alessio’s focus was razor-sharp.
    <br><br>
    With a burst of speed, Alessio vaulted onto a shattered pillar, launching himself at Jiro with the agility of a spider stalking prey. His boots scraped stone; his cap shadowed his determined gaze. The villain hissed as the webs tightened.
    <br><br>
    But Jiro’s power was terrifying, tendrils twisting into flaming whips that cracked like thunder, forcing Alessio to dive away, burning heat licking his skin.
    <br><br>
    The Fire Hero, gathering every ounce of his remaining strength, hurled a blazing spear at Jiro—momentarily stunning him. Alessio seized the moment, shooting a net of silk that enveloped the villain like a spider’s web.
    <br><br>
    With a primal scream, Jiro struggled, shadows writhing against the silk’s unyielding grip.
    <br><br>
    “This ends now!” Alessio shouted, feeling the power of the forest bite and the fire hero’s spirit surge within him.
    <br><br>
    As the villain’s darkness began to suffocate under the unbreakable web, the fire’s roar softened, and the hospital’s lights flickered back to life.
    <br><br>
    Exhausted but victorious, Alessio knelt beside the Fire Hero, whose grateful eyes met his.
    <br><br>
    “You have the heart of a true hero... Spider,” the Fire Hero whispered.
    <br><br>
    Outside, the first rays of dawn pierced the smoke—hope reborn in the flames.
